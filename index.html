                <h3>Various 7+kyu's invloving arrays</h3>
                <p>I've been making life a lot harder for myself on some codewars kata and finding there are much better practices. It's been very valuable going through the solutions voted up as best practice after submitting a solution. Reason being that I've often found there's an array method that does what I spent about 10 lines doing straight away, LOL. Lesson learnt, know your methods. Also in general just have a look if there's a method that will do what you want to do before diving in I suppose.</p>
                <p>Here's an example: <br>This Kata 'Dominant array elements' asks you to write a function that takes an array and then outputs a different array containing all the numbers that are larger than every other number to it's right. My solution took just over 30 mins and was 31 lines. Here's a lovely 1 line solution:</p>
                <img src="./images/kataDominantArr.png">
                <p>The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function. <br>The arrow function shortens the code since you don't need to define the function beforehand. <br>The slice() method slices out a piece of an array. <br>The every() method executes a function for each array element.</p>
                <!-- <p>So... the solution returns a new array after executing a function which </p> -->
